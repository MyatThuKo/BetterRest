  Challenges to complete in this part 3 of project 4...
  <ol> 
    <li> Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!</li>
    <li>Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values. </li>
    <li>Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely. </li>
   </ol>
